        Hello to anybody reading this! My name is (Paul) Daniel Chastain. A 23 year old student who has been passionate
        about
        coding for a very long time. Although, I have around 2-3 coding, beginning with school I have never been able to
        keep a strict schedule. As this blog was put together four or some days ago, I would like to make
        today as the first day offical day of my 100 day code sprint, in aims to land my first webdev internship/job
        opportunity. As you may be able to tell this site doesn't look very good right now, but I hope as time I will
        add a comment section, to this blog, make everything look beautiful.

        Today is day two of coding out of one hundred. Pretty neat to think about that I already making progress. After
        doing some inital reseach, one what it means to be a full on web developer and going through different road maps
        of where I want to be in the next 99 days, I want to manage my time corretly and give myself some sort of to do
        list. From the last 5 days building out my portfolio, retouching on my bootstrap abilities, learned Express.JS.
        AKA the E in the MERN stack. With one project at a time, I want to knock out each component. And instead of
        giving myself time lines, I am going to take a moment to come up with projects for each of these I use.

        <h5>MongoDB</h6>
          <p>MongoDB is a popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database management system. It stores data in a
            JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), which makes it easy to work with and integrate into web
            applications. And for me I love JSON. I have been working with JSON files for years to store data within
            python, downloading information and parsing has always been one of my most favorite skills within my
            developer tool belt. To learn Mongo I plan on using what you are reading right this very second. This blog!
            I want to add a forwards and backwards button for each month, so it is easy for the user to read what kinds
            of information I have stored. My second project will be with my AI Program, as it is my API key people are
            using. I don't want anybody to take advantage, and just build a log. If anybody puts any sort of malcious or
            spam the AI program, I would like to ban their IP address. Although I can think of many ways problem, still
            think it would be neat idea to implement.

          <h5>
            Express.JS
          </h5>
          <p>
            I don't believe I need to implement a learning section for this part. My AI portfolio project found on my
            home page, was something I learned on accident. I've built hundreds of python programs that communicate with
            APIS before, and out of my love AI decided to implement OpenAI into some kind of WebApp. I started with
            Node.JS then found Express.JS would create an API for me and 40 hours of development and many YouTube
            tutorials later, I throughly learned the fundamentals of Express.JS. Tbh I didn't even know what MERN Stack
            was. All the projects I plan on building will implement Express.JS, so no exact plan of focus there. Also
            want to try an Angular project also, so I can say I understand the MEAN stack lol.

          <h5>
            React
          </h5>
          <p>
            I dont know why but the react stack I am slightly afraid at. From my friends who are WebDevs they say it's
            pretty difficult to learn, but once you get the hang of it, it gets better. With research I found that react
            can: Build interactive user interfaces, Reusable components,Server-side rendering,Mobile development, and
            Data visualization. And even has SEO properties because everything is rendered from server, as search
            engines can eaisly crawl and index my pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think for this I know I want to implement AI into this somehow, and include music. So I want to use mongo
            db to index music files and keywords based on the mood of the music. And when the user types in a type of
            mood they want to listen to, react will then display their song seemlessly.

            Node.JS
          </h5>
          <p>
            Although Express.JS is written on top of Node.JS, I would still like to code something that is Node.JS
            exclusive. What that being yet, idk. Something that can interact with other people across the world
            probably. Because my main goal one day is to learn these stacks and some how help the world with my skills.
            As I don't have much money to help in any other way. So maybe starting small, build a Chat Box that anybody
            can talk on. Other ideas coming to mind. Once I get that down, maybe create my own version of pictionary
            that can be played with an AI.
          </p>

            Overall, for the first time ever within my computer science journey. I have a clear path where I want to be
            in 100 days. If I don't become a full stack engineer within the 100 days, and get my first internship. I
            will force myself to go bungeee jump off the highest place I could imagine. Thank you so much for reading
            this, and I am excited to get started.
